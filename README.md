# Image Processing (Python + OpenCV)

This repository contains my Image Processing subject laboratory work completed using 
**Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow, and Matplotlib**.  
All assignments include clear explanations, code implementations, and output visualizations.

## 📌 Lab Assignments Overview

### 🔹 Basic Image Operations
1. Read and display an image  
2. Print image dimensions and data type  
3. Convert RGB image to grayscale and save  
4. Open PNG image using Pillow  
5. Resize image to 50%  
6. Crop central 200×200 region  
7. Rotate image by 180°  
8. Flip image horizontally  
9. Convert RGB → HSV and display each channel  
10. Compute MSE between two images

### 🔹 Histogram, Enhancement & Filtering
1. Compute image histogram manually (NumPy)  
2. Contrast stretching  
3. Histogram equalisation  
4. CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)  
5. Add Gaussian noise + denoise using Gaussian filter  
6. Add Salt & Pepper noise + denoise using Median filter  
7. Apply averaging / box filter  
8. Apply bilateral filter  
9. Plot histogram before/after smoothing  
10. Compare MSE (original vs noisy vs denoised images)
